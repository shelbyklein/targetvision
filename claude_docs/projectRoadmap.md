## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Implement queue, caching
2. **Storage Costs**
   - Mitigation: Use SmugMug URLs, no local storage
3. **Search Performance**
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, pagination

### Business Risks
1. **SmugMug API Changes**
   - Mitigation: Abstract API layer
2. **Claude API Costs**
   - Mitigation: Batch processing, caching
3. **User Adoption**
   - Mitigation: Focus on core photographer needs

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria (End of Week 2)

**Technical Metrics:**
- âœ… 100 photos synced from SmugMug
- âœ… 90%+ photos have AI descriptions
- âœ… Search returns relevant results in < 1 second
- âœ… Zero critical bugs in testing

**User Validation:**
- âœ… SmugMug connection works first try
- âœ… Photos display correctly
- âœ… Search finds expected photos
- âœ… 3+ beta testers confirm value

### Phase 1 Success (Month 1)
- 95% processing success rate
- <500ms search response time
- 20 active users

### Long-term Success (Year 1)
- 1000+ registered users
- 1M+ photos processed
- 4.5+ user satisfaction rating
- Break-even on operational costs

## Go/No-Go Decision Points

### After MVP (Week 2)
- Does search return relevant results?
- Is processing cost sustainable?
- Do users find value?

### After Phase 1 (Month 1)
- Can system handle 10k+ photos?
- Are users actively searching?
- Is SmugMug integration stable?

### After Phase 3 (Month 2)
- Are users editing AI metadata?
- Is retention above 50%?
- Can we differentiate from competitors?

## Dependencies

### External Services
- SmugMug API (critical)
- Claude API (critical)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector (critical)
- AWS S3 (optional - Phase 4)

### Technical Stack
- Python/FastAPI (backend)
- PostgreSQL (database)
- JavaScript (frontend)
- Docker (deployment)

## Budget Estimates

### MVP Phase (First 2 Weeks)
- Claude API: < $1 (100 test photos)
- Hosting: $0 (local development)
- Domain: $0 (use localhost)
- **Total: < $1**

### Beta Phase (Weeks 3-4)
- Claude API: ~$5 (1000+ photos)
- Hosting: $20 (DigitalOcean droplet)
- Domain: $15 (optional)
- **Total: $20-40**

### Production Phase (Monthly)
- Claude API: $500 (10k photos/month)
- Hosting: $100 (scaled infrastructure)
- Database: $50
- CDN: $30
- **Total: $680/month**

## Next Actions
