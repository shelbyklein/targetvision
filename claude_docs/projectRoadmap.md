# Project Roadmap - TargetVision

## Project Vision
Create an intelligent photo management system that enhances SmugMug collections with AI-powered metadata and natural language search capabilities.

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: MVP (Weeks 1-2) âœ… CURRENT
**Goal:** Prove core concept works
- Basic SmugMug OAuth
- Photo sync (100 photos max)
- AI description generation
- Simple vector search
- Minimal web UI

### Phase 1: Production Ready (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal:** Stable, deployable system
- Full album sync with pagination
- Batch processing queue
- Error handling & retry logic
- Session management
- Basic authentication

### Phase 2: Enhanced Search (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal:** Powerful search capabilities
- Natural language queries
- Filter by date/album/keywords
- Similar image search
- Search history
- Saved searches

### Phase 3: Metadata Management (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal:** Full control over AI metadata
- Edit AI descriptions
- Approve/reject suggestions
- Bulk operations
- Version history
- Export capabilities

### Phase 4: Performance & Scale (Weeks 9-10)
**Goal:** Handle large photo libraries
- Incremental sync
- Background processing
- Caching layer
- CDN integration
- Database optimization

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 11-12)
**Goal:** Differentiate from competitors
- Face recognition grouping
- Event detection
- Auto-tagging
- Smart albums
- Sharing capabilities

| Batch Processing | Medium | Medium | P1 |
| Edit Metadata | High | Low | P1 |
| Similar Images | Medium | High | P2 |
| Face Recognition | Low | High | P3 |
| Mobile App | Medium | High | P3 |

## Technical Milestones

### Q1 2025
- [x] Project setup
- [ ] MVP deployment
- [ ] First 10 beta users
- [ ] 1000+ photos processed

### Q2 2025
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] 100+ active users
- [ ] 50k+ photos processed
- [ ] <200ms search latency

### Q3 2025
- [ ] Mobile responsive UI
- [ ] Advanced search features
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Plugin system

### Q4 2025
- [ ] Enterprise features
- [ ] Multi-user support
- [ ] API monetization
- [ ] 1000+ users

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Implement queue, caching
2. **Storage Costs**
   - Mitigation: Use SmugMug URLs, no local storage
3. **Search Performance**
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, pagination

### Business Risks
1. **SmugMug API Changes**
   - Mitigation: Abstract API layer
2. **Claude API Costs**
   - Mitigation: Batch processing, caching
3. **User Adoption**
   - Mitigation: Focus on core photographer needs

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success (Week 2)
- Successfully process 100 photos
- Search returns relevant results
- 5 beta testers provide feedback

### Phase 1 Success (Month 1)
- 95% processing success rate
- <500ms search response time
- 20 active users

### Long-term Success (Year 1)
- 1000+ registered users
- 1M+ photos processed
- 4.5+ user satisfaction rating
- Break-even on operational costs

## Go/No-Go Decision Points

### After MVP (Week 2)
- Does search return relevant results?
- Is processing cost sustainable?
- Do users find value?

### After Phase 1 (Month 1)
- Can system handle 10k+ photos?
- Are users actively searching?
- Is SmugMug integration stable?

### After Phase 3 (Month 2)
- Are users editing AI metadata?
- Is retention above 50%?
- Can we differentiate from competitors?

## Dependencies

### External Services
- SmugMug API (critical)
- Claude API (critical)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector (critical)
- AWS S3 (optional - Phase 4)

### Technical Stack
- Python/FastAPI (backend)
- PostgreSQL (database)
- JavaScript (frontend)
- Docker (deployment)

## Budget Estimates

### MVP Phase
- Claude API: $50 (1000 photos)
- Hosting: $20 (DigitalOcean droplet)
- Domain: $15
- **Total: $85**

### Production Phase (Monthly)
- Claude API: $500 (10k photos/month)
- Hosting: $100 (scaled infrastructure)
- Database: $50
- CDN: $30
- **Total: $680/month**

## Next Actions
1. Complete MVP development
2. Deploy to staging environment
3. Recruit 5 beta testers
4. Gather feedback
5. Plan Phase 1 improvements
