# Bug Report: Album Display State Not Persistent Between Browser Refreshes

**Date Created:** 2025-08-13  
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Component:** StateManager, AlbumBrowser, Navigation  

## Description
When a user is viewing photos within a specific album and refreshes the browser page, the application reverts back to the root albums view instead of maintaining the current album context. This breaks user workflow and creates a poor user experience.

## Expected Behavior
- User selects an album and views its photos
- User refreshes the browser (F5, Ctrl+R, or manual refresh)
- Application should restore to the same album view with photos displayed
- Album context and navigation state should be preserved

## Actual Behavior
- User selects an album and views its photos
- User refreshes the browser
- Application loads back to the root albums/folders view
- Current album selection is lost
- Photos view is replaced with folder grid
- User must navigate back to the album manually

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Albums page
2. Browse and select any album (e.g., "Family Photos")
3. Wait for album photos to load and display
4. Refresh the browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
5. Observe that the app returns to root albums view instead of maintaining album context

## Technical Details
- **Affected Component:** Albums page, photo display, state restoration
- **State Management:** StateManager may not be properly saving/restoring album context
- **URL State:** Album selection may not be reflected in URL parameters
- **Local Storage:** Album state may not be persisted in localStorage

## Impact
- **User Experience:** Poor - users lose their place when refreshing
- **Workflow Interruption:** Users must re-navigate to their album after refresh
- **Productivity:** Reduces efficiency when working with specific albums
- **Severity:** Medium - affects core navigation functionality

## Potential Root Causes
1. **Missing Album State Persistence:** StateManager may not be saving current album selection
2. **URL Parameter Missing:** Album ID not included in URL state for bookmarking/refresh
3. **Restoration Logic Gap:** State restoration may not properly handle album-level context
4. **Event Sequence Issues:** Album loading may not be triggered during app initialization

## Investigation Areas
- **StateManager.js:** Check if `currentAlbum` is being saved and restored properly
- **AlbumBrowser.js:** Verify album selection state management
- **App.js:** Review state restoration flow during initialization
- **URL State Management:** Check if album parameters are included in URL state
- **Event Flow:** Ensure proper event sequence during state restoration

## Files to Investigate
- `/frontend/managers/StateManager.js` - State persistence and restoration logic
- `/frontend/components/AlbumBrowser.js` - Album selection and display logic  
- `/frontend/app.js` - Application initialization and state restoration flow
- `/frontend/components/NavigationManager.js` - Page navigation state
- URL parameter handling and album ID persistence

## Expected Fix Areas
1. **Enhanced State Persistence:** Ensure album selection is saved to localStorage
2. **URL Parameter Integration:** Include album ID in URL for direct linking
3. **Restoration Flow:** Improve state restoration to handle album context
4. **Event Coordination:** Ensure proper event sequence during album restoration

## Test Cases for Fix
- [ ] Select album, refresh browser, verify album view is restored
- [ ] Select album, copy URL, paste in new tab, verify album loads
- [ ] Navigate between albums, refresh, verify last album is restored  
- [ ] Test with different album types (folders vs. albums)
- [ ] Verify breadcrumb navigation is restored correctly

## Additional Context
This issue affects the core user workflow of the photo management system. Users expect their current view to persist across browser refreshes, especially when working within specific albums or collections. The fix should maintain consistency with existing state management patterns while ensuring reliable album context restoration.
