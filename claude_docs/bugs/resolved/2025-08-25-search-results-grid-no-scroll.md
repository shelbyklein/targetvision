# Search Results Grid - No Scroll Capability

**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Resolution Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Component:** SearchManager / PhotoGrid  
**Priority:** Medium  

## Description
The #search-results-grid does not give the user the ability to scroll to see more images when search results exceed the visible area.

## Expected Behavior
- Users should be able to scroll through search results when there are more images than can fit in the visible area
- Search results grid should have proper scrolling behavior (vertical scroll)
- All search results should be accessible via scrolling

## Current Behavior
- Search results grid lacks scrolling capability
- Users cannot access search results beyond the visible area
- Limited visibility of search results

## Affected Areas
- Search functionality
- User experience with search results
- Search results display grid

## Technical Notes
- Likely CSS overflow issue on #search-results-grid
- May need scroll container implementation
- Should maintain responsive design while adding scroll capability

## Resolution
**Root Cause:** The search-results-container had `overflow-hidden` class which prevented scrolling when search results exceeded the visible area.

**Fix Applied:** Changed CSS classes in `/Users/shelbyklein/apps/targetvision/frontend/index.html` line 562:
- Removed: `overflow-hidden`  
- Added: `overflow-y-auto` with `max-height: 70vh`

**Result:** Users can now scroll vertically through search results when there are more images than fit in the visible area. Container is constrained to 70% of viewport height with smooth scrolling behavior.
