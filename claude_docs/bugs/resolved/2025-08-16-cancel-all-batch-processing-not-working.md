# Cancel All Batch Processing Not Working

**Date:** 2025-08-16
**Status:** Fixed - URL Mismatch Resolved
**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** SettingsManager, PhotoProcessor

## Description
When clicking the "Cancel All Batch Processing" button in the settings, the batch processing operations do not actually get cancelled. The button appears to execute but the processing continues in the background.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start a batch processing operation (select multiple photos and process them)
2. Open settings page
3. Click "Cancel All Batch Processing" button
4. Observe that processing continues despite the cancel action

## Expected Behavior
- All active batch processing operations should be immediately terminated
- Processing queue should be cleared
- UI should update to reflect cancelled state
- Progress indicators should stop/reset

## Actual Behavior
- Button click appears to execute but has no effect
- Batch processing continues running in background
- Progress indicators continue showing processing status
- No visible feedback that cancel was attempted

## Impact
- Users cannot stop unwanted or long-running batch operations
- Wastes API quota/credits when users want to stop processing
- Poor user experience with non-functional cancel control
- May cause confusion about whether the feature works

## Root Cause Identified ✅
**URL Mismatch**: Frontend was calling wrong backend endpoint
- **Frontend called**: `/photos/cancel-batch-processing` 
- **Backend endpoint**: `/photos/batch/cancel`

This caused "405 Method Not Allowed" errors visible in server logs.

## Debugging Process ✅
1. **Checked Server Logs**: Found `INFO: "POST /photos/cancel-batch-processing HTTP/1.1" 405 Method Not Allowed`
2. **Verified Backend API**: Found existing endpoint at `/photos/batch/cancel` 
3. **Identified URL Mismatch**: Frontend and backend using different URLs
4. **Applied Fix**: Updated PhotoProcessor to use correct endpoint URL

## Fix Applied ✅
Updated `frontend/managers/PhotoProcessor.js`:
```javascript
// OLD (wrong URL):
const response = await apiService.post('/photos/cancel-batch-processing');

// NEW (correct URL): 
const response = await apiService.post('/photos/batch/cancel');
```
