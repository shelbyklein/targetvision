# Bug: Missing UI and Console Logs for Album Sync Progress

**Date:** 2025-08-14  
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** UI - Progress Display, Logging  

## Issue Description
When albums are syncing, there is insufficient UI feedback and console logging to show users that sync operations are actively in progress.

## Expected Behavior
**UI Requirements:**
- Visual progress indicators during album sync operations
- Real-time status updates showing sync progress
- Clear indication which items are currently being synced
- Progress bars or spinners for active operations
- Toast notifications for sync start/completion

**Console Logging Requirements:**
- Detailed sync progress logs for debugging
- Start/end timestamps for sync operations
- Individual item sync status logging
- Error logging with context for failed syncs
- Performance metrics (items/second, total time)

## Current Behavior
- Limited or no visual feedback during sync operations
- Users uncertain if sync is working or stalled
- Insufficient logging for troubleshooting sync issues
- Poor transparency of system operations

## Impact
- User confusion about sync status
- Difficulty troubleshooting sync problems
- Poor user experience during long sync operations
- Lack of visibility into system performance

## Suggested Implementation
**UI Components:**
1. Progress bars in album cards during sync
2. Sync status indicators in list view
3. Toast notifications for sync events
4. Global sync progress indicator

**Logging Features:**
1. Structured console logs with timestamps
2. Progress percentage logging
3. Individual item sync completion logs
4. Error logs with full context and stack traces
5. Performance metrics logging
