# Bug: Thumbnail Images Not 1:1 Aspect Ratio

**Date:** 2025-08-14  
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Component:** UI - Album Cards - Thumbnails  

## Issue Description
Thumbnail images in album cards do not fill the entire container with a consistent 1:1 aspect ratio, leading to inconsistent visual presentation.

## Expected Behavior
All thumbnail images should:
- Fill the entire thumbnail container completely
- Maintain a consistent 1:1 square aspect ratio
- Use appropriate cropping/scaling to fit the square format
- Present a uniform grid appearance

## Current Behavior
- Images may appear with original aspect ratios
- Inconsistent sizing between different album thumbnails
- Gaps or uneven spacing in the grid layout

## Impact
- Inconsistent visual presentation
- Unprofessional appearance
- Difficulty scanning album grid quickly

## Technical Requirements
- Apply `object-fit: cover` to thumbnail images
- Enforce square container dimensions
- Center-crop images to maintain focus on subject matter
- Ensure responsive behavior across screen sizes

## Suggested Fix
1. Set thumbnail containers to fixed square dimensions
2. Apply CSS object-fit: cover to scale images properly
3. Add object-position: center for optimal cropping
4. Test with various image aspect ratios to ensure consistency
