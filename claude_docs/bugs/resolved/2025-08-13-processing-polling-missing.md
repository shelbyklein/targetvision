# Bug Report: Processing Polling - Missing Real-time Status Updates

**Date Created:** 2025-08-13  
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** Photo Processing, Real-time UI Updates  

## Description
The application may be missing a polling mechanism to check when photo processing is complete and update the UI in real-time. Users may not see status changes immediately after photos finish processing.

## Expected Behavior
- Real-time polling should check processing status of photos
- UI should automatically update when photos complete processing
- Status indicators should change from "processing" to "completed" without page refresh
- Processing progress should update dynamically during batch operations
- System information statistics should refresh automatically

## Actual Behavior
- UI may not update automatically when processing completes
- Users may need to refresh page to see updated processing status
- No real-time feedback during long processing operations
- Processing status may become stale without manual refresh

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start processing photos (individual or batch)
2. Observe processing status indicators
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. Check if UI automatically updates to show completion
5. Verify if system statistics refresh automatically

## Technical Details
- **Missing Component**: Real-time polling mechanism for processing status
- **Affected Areas**: Photo status indicators, progress bars, system statistics
- **Expected Polling**: Check processing status every 2-5 seconds during active operations
- **Status Updates**: Photo grid status icons, progress indicators, completion notifications

## Impact
- **User Experience**: No real-time feedback on processing progress
- **Functionality**: Users unaware when processing completes
- **Workflow**: Manual refresh required to see current status
- **Severity**: High - affects core processing feedback loop

## Potential Root Causes
1. **Missing Polling Logic**: No periodic status check implementation
2. **Removed Functionality**: Polling may have been disabled/removed during refactoring
3. **Component Integration**: Processing status polling not integrated with new modular architecture
4. **Event System**: Missing event-driven status update mechanism

## Investigation Required
- Search for existing polling mechanisms in codebase
- Check if PhotoProcessor has status checking functionality
- Verify if ProgressManager handles real-time updates
- Review event system for processing status events
- Determine if polling was lost during Phase 4 refactoring

## Technical Requirements
- **Polling Interval**: 2-5 second intervals during active processing
- **Smart Polling**: Only poll when processing is active
- **Event Integration**: Use EventBus for status update notifications
- **Performance**: Efficient polling that doesn't overload server
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of polling failures

## Suggested Implementation
1. **ProcessingPoller Service**: New service for managing polling operations
2. **Smart Activation**: Start polling when processing begins, stop when idle
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: Emit events when status changes detected
4. **Component Integration**: ProgressManager and PhotoGrid listen for updates
5. **Batch Operations**: Enhanced polling during batch processing

## Files to Investigate
- `/frontend/managers/PhotoProcessor.js` - Processing management
- `/frontend/components/ProgressManager.js` - Progress tracking
- `/frontend/components/PhotoGrid.js` - Status indicator updates
- `/frontend/services/` - Check for existing polling services
- Search for polling, interval, setTimeout patterns in codebase

## Related Features
- Photo processing progress tracking
- Real-time status updates
- Batch processing feedback
- System monitoring and statistics
- User notification system

## Priority Justification
High priority because real-time feedback is essential for user experience during photo processing operations. Users need to know when processing completes without manual intervention.
