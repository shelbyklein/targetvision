# Navigation and Connection Status Overlap on Mobile

**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: Header/Navigation  

## Bug Description

On smaller screens (mobile devices), the navigation buttons and connection status text are overlapping, making the interface difficult to use and read.

## Affected Elements

- Navigation buttons (Albums, Collections, Chat, Search, Settings)
- Connection status text ("AI Available Connected to SmugMug (@username)")
- Header layout on mobile/tablet screens

## Visual Issues

- Text overlaps with navigation buttons
- Navigation buttons may be partially obscured
- Poor user experience on mobile devices
- Readability issues for status information

## Expected Behavior

- Navigation buttons should remain fully visible and clickable
- Connection status should be readable without overlap
- Header should adapt responsively to smaller screen sizes
- Clean separation between navigation and status elements

## Current Behavior

- Elements overlap and interfere with each other on smaller screens
- Navigation may be difficult to use
- Status text may be unreadable

## Suggested Solutions

1. **Responsive Layout**: Implement responsive design that stacks elements vertically on smaller screens
2. **Text Truncation**: Truncate or abbreviate connection status on mobile
3. **Collapsible Navigation**: Use hamburger menu for navigation on mobile
4. **Status Icon Only**: Show only status indicator dot on mobile, full text on hover/tap
5. **Separate Rows**: Move connection status to separate row below navigation

## Technical Considerations

- CSS media queries for responsive breakpoints
- Flexbox or Grid layout adjustments
- Mobile-first design approach
- Touch-friendly button sizing
- Accessibility for mobile users

## Impact

- Degrades mobile user experience
- May prevent users from accessing navigation on mobile devices
- Affects overall application usability on smaller screens
