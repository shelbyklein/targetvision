# Async Listener Message Channel Error

**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: Frontend/Browser Extension Communication  

## Bug Description

Browser console error occurring when navigating to album URLs:

```
:3000/?album=brdRnR&â€¦2Fnode%252F9T9zkL:1 Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
```

## Error Details

- **URL Context**: `localhost:3000/?album=brdRnR&...2Fnode%252F9T9zkL`
- **Error Type**: Uncaught Promise Error
- **Location**: Browser console
- **Trigger**: Album navigation

## Likely Cause

This error typically occurs when:
1. A browser extension or service worker returns `true` to indicate async response
2. The message channel closes before the async operation completes
3. Could be related to browser extension interference or incomplete Promise handling

## Potential Impact

- May cause navigation issues
- Could affect album loading performance
- Might interfere with page functionality
- Creates console noise and debugging confusion

## Investigation Steps

1. Check if browser extensions are interfering
2. Review EventBus async event handling
3. Examine album navigation Promise chains
4. Test in incognito mode to isolate extension issues
5. Review any service worker implementations

## Possible Solutions

1. Add proper error handling for async message listeners
2. Ensure all Promise chains have proper catch blocks
3. Review EventBus event handlers for incomplete async operations
4. Add timeout handling for async operations
5. Consider browser extension compatibility issues

## Browser Context

- Appears to be browser/extension related rather than application code
- May need defensive programming to handle browser environment variations
