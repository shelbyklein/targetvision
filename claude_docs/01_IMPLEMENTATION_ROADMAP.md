## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| LLM API Costs | High | Implement caching, batch processing, rate limiting |
| Large Photo Libraries | Medium | Use pagination, lazy loading, CDN |
| Slow Search Performance | High | Optimize indexes, use caching, consider dedicated vector DB |
| Privacy Concerns | High | Offer local processing option, encryption at rest |
| Model Hallucinations | Medium | Implement confidence scoring, user feedback loop |

## Notes
- Each phase includes buffer time for unexpected issues
- Phases can overlap where dependencies allow
- Regular reviews at the end of each phase
- Adjust timeline based on team size and resources
