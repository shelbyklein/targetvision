# Interactive Image Selection/Approval Mode

**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Status**: Requested  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: PhotoGrid, ModalManager  

## Feature Request

Add an interactive approval mode that allows users to quickly approve or unapprove images in an album, enabling selective photo management since not all photos in an album may be desired.

## Proposed Implementation

### UI Components
- Toggle button to enter/exit "Approval Mode"
- Visual indicators for approved/unapproved status (checkmarks, X marks, or color coding)
- Keyboard shortcuts for rapid approval (spacebar = approve, X = reject)
- Bulk approval actions (approve all visible, reject all visible)

### User Experience
1. User enters approval mode via toggle button
2. Photos display with clear approve/reject visual states
3. Single click toggles approval status
4. Keyboard navigation for rapid processing
5. Progress indicator showing approval completion percentage
6. Filter options to show only approved/unapproved photos

### Technical Considerations
- Add `approved` boolean field to photo metadata
- Modify PhotoGrid component to handle approval mode state
- Update photo status indicators to show approval state
- Integrate with existing selection system
- Add approval status to search/filter capabilities

### Integration Points
- **PhotoGrid**: Primary component for approval interactions
- **ModalManager**: Support approval actions in photo modal view
- **SearchManager**: Filter by approval status
- **Collections**: Only include approved photos in collections
- **Database**: Store approval status in photo metadata

## Business Value
- Improved photo curation workflow
- Faster album organization
- Better user control over photo collections
- Enhanced photo management experience
