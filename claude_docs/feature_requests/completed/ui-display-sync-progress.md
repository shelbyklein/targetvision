# Feature Request: UI Display for Sync Progress

**Date:** 2025-08-14  
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Component:** UI/UX - Progress Display  

## Summary
Add visual progress indicators to show sync operation progress in the user interface.

## Current State
Sync operations (album sync, photo sync) happen in the background with minimal user feedback about progress status.

## Requested Feature
Implement comprehensive UI elements to display sync progress including:

### Visual Elements
- Progress bars for sync operations
- Real-time status updates
- Completion indicators
- Error state visualization

### Information Display
- Items synced vs. total items
- Current operation status
- Estimated time remaining
- Success/failure counts

## User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to see progress when syncing albums so I know the operation is working
2. **As a user**, I want to know how many items have been synced and how many remain
3. **As a user**, I want to see if any errors occur during sync operations
4. **As a user**, I want to be able to cancel long-running sync operations

## Technical Considerations
- Integrate with existing ToastManager for notifications
- Use ProgressManager for loading states
- Consider WebSocket or polling for real-time updates
- Handle error states gracefully
- Provide cancel functionality for long operations

## Benefits
- Improved user experience during sync operations
- Better transparency of system operations
- Reduced user anxiety about long-running processes
- Clear feedback on operation success/failure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Progress bars visible during sync operations
- [ ] Real-time status updates
- [ ] Clear completion/error messaging
- [ ] Cancel operation functionality
- [ ] Responsive design for all screen sizes
